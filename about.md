<blockquote>
Dancing connects me to the scope of sensations, all at once I can connect to my clear form, to my animal, to my passion with the sense of existence. Dancing is not about performing, itâ€™s an intimate act you can do alone. It is about allowing chaos to find it comfort zone: dancing is like being in an eye of a storm which is a very quiet place. - Ohad Hanarin, "Move"
