<p>
Lena Petrova is a Russian-born contemporary dancer, performer, model, martial artist and shuffle dance teacher currently living in Berlin.
</p>

She received her initial training in Saint-Petersburg Sports Dance Federation, and later relocated to Berlin where she now studies contemporary and classical dance at [Danceworks Berlin](https://en.danceworks.berlin/) and teaches shuffle dance at [shuffle house](https://www.shuffle.house/).

<p>
Her main focus of work is body research and exploration. Having personal history with domestic violence and abuse, she poses herself questions on how psychological blocks and fears can be overcame with body movement, what it means to feel "safe" in one's body and go beyond familiar limits.

Dancing connects me to the scope of sensations, all at once I can connect to my clear form, to my animal, to my passion with the sense of existence. Dancing is about allowing chaos to find its comfort zone: it is like being in an eye of a storm, which is a very quiet place. - Ohad Hanarin, "Move"
